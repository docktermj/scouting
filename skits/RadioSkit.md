### 2025 Tesomas Staff Reunion revival

- Date: 2025-08-23
- Place: Camp Tesomas, Grand Council Ring
- Actors: Michael Dockter, Dave Schuh, Peter Kester, Jim Hartwig, John Van Dreese
- Introduction

    > The year is 1977, camp staff week some 48 years ago.
    > The Aquatics Staff realizes that they don't have a script for opening campfire.
    > So between their scheduled tanning sessions, they craft a skit so simple that they can't screw it up.
    > It's known as "The Radio Skit".

    > Before you are the original Tesomas Cast members from 1977.
    >
    > - Mike Dockter, Aquatics 1977.
    > - Dave Schuh, Aquatics 1977 and ceremonies director.
    > - Pete Emanuel.  (Pause) Sorry, Pete couldn't be with us tonight. However, we are fortunate to have his understudy of 48 years, Pete Kester.
    > - Jim Hartwig, Aquatic Director 1977.
    > - John Van Dreese,  Program Director 1977.   Why a Program Director?  The skit calls for 5 people and there were only 4 on the waterfront.
    >
    > We present the original cast of "The Radio Skit".
